# Test Pi scripts

Test the integrity of the Pi language.

This doesn't use external files or scripts to test, so it's called "TestInlinePi".

The test suites *TestPi* and *TestRho* exercise all the scripts in **Source/Test/Scripts/{Pi,Rho}**.

These "inline" tests do not use external scripts. This allows for faster iteration for debgging and refinement.
