# Window

I decided to find and use the UI frame-work that was most portable
and small.

It came down to FLTK. 

It's pretty cool and very minimalistic but I haven't tried it on 
much other than Ubuntu (easy) and OSX (initial attempt to build from
source failed).

But, FLTK supposedly works on everything. I wrote my stuff to use FLTK.

Up to you to get an installation of FLTK up and running. If not, there's
always the __Console__.
