# Console

A basic colored console interface to an Executor.

## Usage

Just some notes before I add tests for them and they fall from memory.

'>' means a prompt.

'#' starts a comment


```bash
> # get current scope
> .
> # show contents of current scope
> . ls 
> # show contents of /Bin object
> /Bin ls
> # show contents of current scope
> lls
```
