# Console ![Console](/Images/Console.png)

A basic colored console interface to an [Executor](/Source/Library/Executor/Source).

Just some notes before I add tests for them and they fall from memory.

This is a terrible introduction to the Executor. My apoligies. Read the code if you're interested, or some [Tests](Test/Language/TestRho/FunctionRhoScripting.cpp).

I don't have many tests that target the Executor directly (I should!). Rather, the Pi and Rho tests indirecly test the Executor.
