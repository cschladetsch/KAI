# Hlsl

HLSL is a *High Level Shader Language* created by Microsoft to support development of shaders for DirectX9+ GPUs.

It was 'improved' with *Cg* language, but it seems GLSL, supported by OpenGL, Unity3d and Kronos is gaining wider support.

This language library will produce an AST for a HLSL shader file, which can then be used to generate appropriate GLSL shader coder.

An ultimate goal is to easily use the raymarching depth-field shaders from [ShaderToy](www.shadertoy.com) in 360 Unity3d VR apps and experiences.
