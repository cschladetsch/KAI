# Installing KAI

The general idea is that you use cmake:

	$ mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make && sudo make install

Best wishes.

There is a GUI-based comand interpreter for the Pi and Rho languages as well, located in App/Window folder. This has only ever worked on Ubunutu and similar systems.
