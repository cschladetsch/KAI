# Test Pi scripts

Test the integrity of the Pi language.

This doesn't use external files or scripts to test, so it's called "RawTestPi".

The test suites TestPi and TestRho exercise all the scripts in Test/Bin/{Pi,Rho}.

This test is quite old, and was made before all the other languages were added. That's why it's a special case.

## Deprecated

This should probably be removed and just rely on the script-based tests.
