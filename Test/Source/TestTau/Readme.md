# Tau 

***Tau*** is an **Interface Definition Language** (IDL) for the network system in **KAI/Network**.

It is used to create both *Proxies* and *Agents* for entities that are network-addressable via KAI Nodes.

See /Bin/NetworkGenerate for more details.

These tests ensure that the Tau system generates correct Proxy and Agent C++ code from a .tau file.
