# Binaries produced by the test system

This folder contains binaries produced to test the KAI system.

In the *Pi*, *Rho* and *Tau* folders are scripts used by the tests.

## Tau Tests

It gets a bit complicated, because the tests for the Tau system have to test generated C++ code. So the test should run, which generates code, which should then be built and ran and tested again.

Haven't done this yet.
