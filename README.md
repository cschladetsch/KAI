KAI
===

KAI provides an Object Model for C++ with full reflection, persistence, and incremental garbage collection.

The library also offers two scripting languages: Pi, which is based on RPN notation, and Rho, which uses infix notation.

Continuations (also known as co-routines or fibres) are natively supported in both Pi and Rho languages.

This library will be useful to those that want to expose their C++ types and instances to the runtime. It allows you to script C++ in a very simple way.

A REPL console application is also supplied.

For a quick intro, see a unit tests at  https://github.com/cschladetsch/KAI/blob/master/Projects/Library/Source/Tests/TestExample.cpp.
