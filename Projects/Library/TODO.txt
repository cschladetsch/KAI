DONE Fix the bug in TestExample.cpp
Fix fault where a crash occurs after trying to continue a continuation compiled from a string in the console.
	- this seems to be because the Ip isn't set after a Duplicate operation
	- grep for FIXME

Re-assert ConstNess
	- Get IsConst working again
	- Use this to make Duplicate operation fast, by not duplicating cost objects

Cache results of IsValid and GetConstStorage between gc cycles
	- each object caches results, with a number called the GcNumber stored in the registry
	- when a registry does a GC, it increments the GcNumber
	- cached results are invalidated when the GcNumbers do not match
