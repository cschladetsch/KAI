# KAI Applications

There are are a number of applications of KAI. This folder contains all of the root applications, including:

1. **Console**. A basic colored console interface to an Executor.
1. **GuiConsole**. New console based on ImGui.
1. **RakNetChat**. Will be removed soon. Just a basic copy of a sample from RakNet, to get all the CMake systems working.
1. **NetworkGen**. Used to generate _Agents_ and _Proxies_ for networking.
1. **NetworkPeer**. More advanced: will be a way to connect and communicate with other peers.
