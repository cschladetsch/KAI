# Executor

An **Executor** does things on other things; it changes state of objects via execution of continuations.

There is one commone *Executor* for muliple languages. Think of the **Executor** as the *Virtual Machine* for the KAI system.

**KAI** supports many languages: they are all executed on the same type of *Executor*.
