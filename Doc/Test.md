# Unit Tests

See the [Unit Tests](https://github.com/cschladetsch/KAI/tree/master/Source/Test/Source) here. Locally they are just in ${KAI_HOME}/Source/Test.

There is a Readme in there too, and new Readme in each test folder.

They are of course not comprehensive, but they give an idea.

Tests are what I am working on the most at the moment.
